// convert old anvio contigs databases

~/pangenomics/FS842 $ anvi-migrate-db CONTIGS.db 
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.
  from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters
Database Path ................................: CONTIGS.db
Detected Type ................................: contigs
Current Version ..............................: 8
Target Version ...............................: 10
* The anvi'o contigs database has just been updated with a description that                                                                                                                                 
contains 4 words and 23 characters.

* The contigs database is now 9! All this upgrade did was to associate your
contigs db with a project name (which happened to be 'NO_NAME', because anvi'o
likes you very much)

Auxiliary data file found ....................: CONTIGS.h5
Contigs found ................................: 8,998
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
* The contigs database is now 10, and the now-obsolete '.h5' file is gone forever
and ever.

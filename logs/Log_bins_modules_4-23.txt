Anvi'o made things up for you
===============================================
You are generating a new anvi'o contigs database, but you are not specifying a
project name for it. FINE. Anvi'o, in desperation, will use the input file name
to set the project name for this contigs database (which is
'MidCaymanRise_FS854_idba_assembly_fixed'). If you are not happy with that, feel
free to kill and restart this process. If you are not happy with this name, but
you don't like killing things either, maybe next time you should either name
your FASTA files better, or use the `--project-name` parameter to set your
desired name.

Name .........................................: MidCaymanRise_FS854_idba_assembly_fixed
Description ..................................: No description is given
Split Length .................................: 20,000
K-mer size ...................................: 4
Skip gene calling? ...........................: False
External gene calls provided? ................: FS854_external_gene_calls_matrix.txt
Ignoring internal stop codons? ...............: True
Splitting pays attention to gene calls? ......: True
External gene calls ..........................: 233218 gene calls recovered and will be processed.

WARNING
===============================================
Please read this carefully: Your external gene calls contained open reading
frames with internal stop codons, and you asked anvi'o to ignore those. Anvi'o
replaced internal stop codons with 'X' characters, and stored them in the
contigs database that way. 3575 of your genes, which corresponded to 1.53% of
the total 233218 genes, had internal stop codons. We hope you are happy.

# a script to parse anvio files that show coverages of bins
# across samples and return an orderly excel/tsv file with normalized results

# set up arg parser
# list of sample files/bins that I want (formatted in some way to match bins to their samples)
# list of bin taxonomies to fix bin names
# normalization factors



# read in each file
# create a df
# stack it onto the existing df

# change all the column (sample) names to make more sense

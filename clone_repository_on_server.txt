Instructions for cloning an existing Git repository (that you may already have on your local computer) onto a server. You might do this if you want to easily work on the same files on your local computer and server without using scp all the time. This is NOT for creating a new remote for a repository on your server. 

1. Find the repository you want to clone on GitHub
2. Click on the green "Clone or Download" button and click "use SSH" to get the SSH clone URL. It might look something like git@github.com:galambosd/meta-omics.git. 
3. Log on to the server as usual: ssh user@xx.xx.xx
4. Clone your repository as usual: git clone <repository_url> (use the SSH URL you just got)
5. Follow the instructions at https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux, including step 3 (adding an SSH key to your account). Make sure the tab at the top of the page has the correct OS selected (Baross runs Linux). 
6. After this, you should be able to push and pull the repository from the server. If you created a passphrase while making your SSH key, the server may prompt you for it once in a while.
